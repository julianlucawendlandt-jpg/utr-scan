"""GENCODE -> one canonical transcript per gene, with its 5'UTR length.

    python scripts/human_utrs.py --dataset human-40s
        -> cache/human_utr_lengths.tsv

This is the human replacement for scripts/call_utr_boundaries.py.  In yeast we
had to find transcript starts from Input-fraction coverage, because the R64
annotation carries exactly four 5'UTR features.  GENCODE annotates UTRs
comprehensively, so here the boundaries are a parse, not a measurement -- and
there is no Input fraction in a 40S-only dataset to measure them with anyway.

WHICH TRANSCRIPT.  GENCODE v49 has ~250k transcripts over ~20k protein-coding
genes, most of them minor isoforms with their own TSS.  Scoring all of them
would mean the same locus appearing dozens of times with different leaders and
the same reads divided between them.  We take the MANE Select transcript: one
per protein-coding gene, agreed between Ensembl and RefSeq, tagged directly in
the GTF.  That is a stated, reproducible choice rather than a heuristic.

Its cost: a gene whose dominant isoform in HEK293T is not the MANE one gets
the wrong leader.  Without cell-type TSS data (CAGE) there is no way to know,
and adding CAGE is a second dataset and a different script.

SPLICED LEADERS, which yeast did not have.  A human 5'UTR is often split
across introns, and the chain walks a CONTIGUOUS genomic window upstream of
the AUG.  Running that window across an intron would feed the model intronic
sequence the ribosome never sees, and project SSU counts onto positions that
are not in the mRNA.

So the window we emit is the length of the LAST 5'UTR exon -- the one
immediately upstream of the start codon, which is contiguous in the genome by
construction.  For a single-exon leader that is the whole thing.  For a
spliced one it is the 3'-most piece, and the rest is dropped.

That is a real truncation, not a formality, so the table carries both numbers:
column 2 is the window actually used and column 3 is the full spliced length.
The script reports how much is lost.  Modelling the whole spliced leader would
mean carrying transcript coordinates through the counting and the sequence
extraction as well, which is a larger change than this one.
