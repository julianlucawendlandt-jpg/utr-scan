"""Deterministic chromosome-group folds, frozen to JSON and reused everywhere.

Chromosomes are assigned to folds greedily, heaviest first, each to the fold
with the least read depth so far (longest-processing-time scheduling), which
balances total 40S depth to within one chromosome.  The depth used is the
leader reads of the balancing dataset summed over its replicates -- pooling
is fine HERE because it only decides which chromosomes go together, never
what is fitted or scored.

Once written, the JSON is the source of truth: freeze() refuses to overwrite
an existing assignment unless asked, so every model in every script sees the
same folds.
